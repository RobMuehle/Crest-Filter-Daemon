# Crest-Filter-Daemon
This program filters molecular conformers per energy using successivley higher levels of DFT (using the ORCA program) and calculates the NMR parameters of each eligible conformer. A list of conformers generated by the CREST program has to be provided.  

The program uses SLURM to massively parallelize the necessary calculations.
